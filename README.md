## Jump-Froggy

The project is based on Greedy Algorithm to get a solution for any array input set ranging from 1to3.
The front end part includes html and css along with javascript for the logical part.
To present it as a 2-D game, Phaser JS is used which helps rendering html5 games on web browser supporting canvas.
